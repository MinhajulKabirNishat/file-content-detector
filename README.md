# file-content-detector
AI-Powered File Content Type Detection

# Project Overview

This project detects the real content type of a file by analyzing its actual data, not just the file extension.
It helps identify whether a file is a PDF, image, text, audio, video, or other type — even if the file name is misleading.

🟢 BEGINNER LEVEL

Detect file types using file content (magic numbers / headers) instead of file extensions.

# How it Works (Simple)

-Read the first few bytes of a file

-Match known file signatures (magic numbers)

-Return the detected file type

🛠 Technologies Used

-Python

-Built-in file handling

🟡 INTERMEDIATE LEVEL (Coming soon)

Improve detection using machine learning when rule-based detection fails.
